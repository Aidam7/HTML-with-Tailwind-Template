# HTML with Tailwind template

Just a simple HTML with Tailwind template in case God decides to torture me again with pure HTML

## How to run:

1. Run `npm i`
2. Run `npm run tailwind`
3. Run `npm run server`

In case you plan to seriously deploy this thing, I'd reccomend running `npm run build`, just remember to update your stylesheet import, I'm not putting more work into this
